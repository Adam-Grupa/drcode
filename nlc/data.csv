Chronic_relapsing_inflammatory_optic_neuropathy ,Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION)  sometimes called chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis  is a form of recurrent optic neuritis that is steroid responsive. Patients typically present with pain associated with visual loss. CRION is a diagnosis of exclusion  and other demyelinating  autoimmune  and systemic causes should be ruled out. Early recognition is crucial given risks for severe visual loss and because it is treatable with immunosuppressive treatment such as steroids. Relapse that occurs after reducing or stopping steroids is a characteristic feature
Coca-Cola_treatment_of_phytobezoars ,The presence of a bezoar is a relatively infrequent disorder that affects the gastrointestinal system. It consists of a solid and formed mass trapped in the gastrointestinal system  usually in the stomach. These can also form in other locations.Gastric phytobezoars are a form of intestinal blockage and are seen in those with poor gastric motility. The preferred treatment of bezoars includes different therapies and/or fragmentation to avoid surgery. Phytobezoars  are most common and consist undigested  lignin  cellulose  and tannin  celery  pumpkins  grape skins  prunes  raisins  vegetables and fruits Phytobezoars can form after eating persimmons and pineapples. These are more difficult to treat and are referred to as diospyrobezoars.Coca-Cola has been proposed for the treatment of gastric phytobezoars. In about 50% of cases studied  Coca-Cola alone was found to be effective in gastric phytobezoar dissolution. Unfortunately  this treatment can result in the potential of developing small bowel obstruction in a minority of cases  necessitating surgical intervention. It is one of many other stomach disorders that can have similar symptoms.
IgG4-related_skin_disease ,IgG4-related skin disease is the recommended name for skin manifestations in IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Multiple different skin manifestations have been described.
Nitrogen_dioxide_poisoning ,Nitrogen dioxide poisoning is the illness resulting from the toxic effect of Nitrogen (II) oxide. It usually occurs after the inhalation of the gas beyond the threshold limit value.Nitrogen (II) oxide is reddish-brown with very a sharp  harsh smell at high concentrations. It is colourless and odourless at lower concentration but yet harmful. Nitrogen dioxide poisoning depends on the duration  frequency and intensity of exposure.Nitrogen (II) oxide is an irritant of the mucous membrane linked with other air pollutant that causes pulmonary diseases such as OLD  asthma  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sometimes Acute exacerbation of COPD and in fatal cases  deaths.Its poor solubility in water enhances its passage and its ability to pass through the moist oral mucosa of the respiratory tract.Like most toxic gases  the dose inhaled determines the toxicity on the respiratory tract. Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and domestic exposure is uncommon. Prolonged exposure to low concentration of the gas may have lethal effects  as can short-term exposure to high concentrations like Chlorine gas poisoning. It is one of the major air pollutant capable of causing severe heath hazards such as Coronary artery disease as well as Stroke.Nitrogen (II) oxide is often released into the environment as a byproduct of fuel combustion but rarely released by Spontaneous combustion. Known sources of Nitrogen gas poisoning includes automobile exhaust  Power stations  The toxicity may also results from non-combustible sources such as the one released from anaerobic fermentation of food grains and Anaerobic digestion of Biodegradable waste.The WHO developed a global recommendation limiting exposures less than 20 part per billion for chronic exposure and value less 100ppb for one hour for acute exposure  using Nitrogen (II)oxide as a marker for other pollutant from fuel combustions. The standardss also based on the concentration of Nitrogen (II) oxide that show a significant and profound effects on the function of the pulmonary of asthmatic patients.Historically  some states in the U.S including Chicago and L.A have high levels of Nitrogen (II) oxide but the EPA set a standard values less than 100 ppb for one hour exposure and less than 53 ppb for chronic exposure.
Radial_nerve_dysfuction ,Radial nerve dysfunction is also known as radial neuropathy or radial mononeuropathy. It is a problem associated with the radial nerve resulting from injury consisting of acute trauma to the radial nerve. The damage has sensory consequences  as it interferes with the radial nerve's innervation of the skin of the posterior forearm  lateral three digits  and the dorsal surface of the lateral side of the palm. The damage also has motor consequences  as it interferes with the radial nerve's innervation of the muscles associated with the extension at the elbow  wrist  and figers  as well the supination of the forearm. This type of injury can be difficult to localize  but relatively common  as many ordinary occurrences can lead to the injury and resulting mononeuropathy. One out of every ten patients suffering from radial nerve dysfunction do so because of a fractured humerus.
Sleep_hollow ,Sleep hollow is medical disease apparently only in humans causing them to sleep for days or weeks at a time. This disease has only been reported in a remote village of Kalachi in Kazakhstan. It was first reported in March  2013 and so far has claimed 152 victims. The disease is probably non-communicable. The disease disappeared for some time but has re-emerged in mid 2015. The disease affects all age groups.
Smokeless_tobacco_keratosis ,Smokeless tobacco keratosis (abbreviated to STK  also termed snuff dippers' keratosis  smokeless tobacco-associated keratosis  snuff pouch  snuff dipper's lesion  tobacco pouch keratosis  or spit tobacco keratosis) is a condition which develops on the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth) in response to smokeless tobacco use. Generally it appears as a white patch  located at the point where the tobacco is held in the mouth. The condition usually disappears once the tobacco habit is stopped. It is associated with slightly increased risk of mouth cancer.
Tooth_ankylosis ,Tooth ankylosis refers to a fusion (ankylosis) of teeth to bone. The condition is diagnosed with radiographs (X-rays)  which show loss of the periodontal ligament space and blending of the root with the bone. Clinically the tooth sounds solid when percussed (tapped) compared to the dull  cushioned sound from normal teeth. Ankylosis of teeth is uncommon  more so in deciduous teeth than permanent teeth.
Tubulointerstitial_nephritis_and_uveitis ,Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) is a rare medical condition in which there is uveitis (inflammation of the uvea in the eye) together with tubulointerstitial nephritis (inflammation of the tubules inside the kidney). It may be accompanied by nonspecific systemic symptoms such as fever  involuntary weight loss  fatigue  loss of appetite  abdominal pain  and joint pains.It was first described in 1975.
Acromesomelic_dysplasia ,Acromesomelic dysplasia is a rare skeletal disorder that causes abnormal bone and cartilage development  leading to shortening of the forearms  lower legs  hands  feet  fingers  and toes. Five different genetic mutations have been implicated. Treatment is individualized but is generally aimed at palliating symptoms  for example  treatment of kyphosis and lumbar hyperlordosis.
Ameloblastic_carcinoma ,Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare form of odontogenic tumor  one that develops in the jawbones from the epithelial cells that generate the tooth enamel. Symptoms include swelling in the jaw and pain  both of which get worse as the cancer grows. It is usually treated with surgery; chemotherapy has not been proven to be effective.
Breast_atrophy ,Breast atrophy is the normal or spontaneous atrophy or shrinkage of the breasts.Breast atrophy commonly occurs in women during menopause when estrogen levels decrease and androgen levels increase. It can also be caused by hypoestrogenism and/or hyperandrogenism in women in general  such as in antiestrogen administration for the treatment of breast cancer  in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  and in malnutrition such as that associated with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa or with chronic disease. It can also be an effect of weight loss.In the treatment of gynecomastia in males and macromastia in women  and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for trans men  breast atrophy may be a desired effect.Examples of treatment options for breast atrophy  depending on the situation/when appropriate  can include estrogens  antiandrogens  and proper nutrition or weight gain.
Chlorine_gas_poisoning ,Chlorine gas poisoning  also known as bertholite poisoning is illness resulting from the toxic effect of chlorine in its gaseous states. It occurs after the inhalation of chlorine gas beyond the threshold limit value. Chlorine gas is a toxic gas and pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage to the receptors in the epithelium of the respiratory tract. The dose inhaled determines the toxicity on the respiratory tract. Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk of toxicity and common domestic exposure results from the mixing of chlorine bleach with acidic washing agents such as acetic  nitric and phosphoric acid. Prolonged exposure to low concentration of chlorine gas may have lethal effects  as can short-term exposure to high concentrations. Chlorine gas damages the respiratory tract using a chloride shift mechanism involving the exchange of bicarbonate (HCO3−) and chloride (Cl−) across the membrane of red blood cells (RBCs).The cell membranes of red blood cells are impermeable to hydrogen ions but exchange bicarbonate ions for chloride ions using the anion exchanger protein Band 3 and a rise in intracellular bicarbonate causes chloride intake and bicarbonate export. As a result  blood chloride concentration is lower in systemic venous blood than in pulmonary circulation because the levels of CO2 and therefore bicarbonate are higher in systemic venous blood  providing less of a driving force for exchange. Excess chlorine gas in the lung and bloodstream deregulate the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen through the chloride ion acting as an allosteric inhibitor.Symptoms of mild acute poisoning include sneezing  tearing  nose irritation and throat irritation  while larger exposures can lead to significant toxicity of the respiratory tract and heart and sometimes death. Following acute poisoning  long-term sequelae often occur and chronic exposure to low levels of chlorine gas can lead to memory loss.
Collagen-induced_arthritis ,Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a condition induced in mice (or rats) to study rheumatoid arthritis.CIA is induced in mice by injecting them with an emulsion of complete Freund's adjuvant and type II collagen.In rats only one injection is needed  mice are normally injected twice.
Harrison_Syndrome ,Harrison Syndrome is a type of chronic gout associated with presence of tophi.
IgG4-related_ophthalmic_disease ,IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) is the recommended term to describe orbital manifestations of the systemic condition IgG4-related disease  which is characterised by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration  follicle formation and fibrosclerosis of involved structures. It can involve one or more of the orbital structures.Frequently involved structures include the lacrimal glands  extraocular muscles  infraorbital nerve  supraorbital nerve and eyelids.A prompt response to steroid therapy is a characteristic feature of IgG4-ROD in most cases  as it is with other manifestations of IgG4-related disease  unless significant fibrosis has already occurred.
Inflammatory_aortic_aneurysm ,Inflammatory aortic aneurysm (IAA)  also know as Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA)  is a type of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) where the walls of the aneurysm become thick and inflamed. Similar to AAA  IAA occurs in the abdominal region. IAA is closely associated and believed to be a response to and extensive peri-anuerysmal fibrosis  which is the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process IAA accounts for 5-10% of aortic aneurysms. IAA is occurs mainly in a population that is on average younger by 10 years than most AAA patients. Some common symptoms of IAA may include back pain  abdominal tenderness  fevers  weight loss or elevated Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs have been found to decrease symptoms and the degree of peri-aortic inflammation and fibrosis
Mammoplasia , antidepressants mirtazapine and bupropion do not increase prolactin levels (bupropion may actually decrease prolactin levels)  and hence there may be no risk with these agents. Other drugs that have been associated with mammoplasia include D-penicillamine  bucillamine  neothetazone (neotizide/thiacetazone)  indinavir  cyclosporine  marijuana  and cimetidine.A 1997 study found an association between the SSRIs and mammoplasia in 23 (39%) of its 59 female participants. Studies have also found associations between SSRIs and galactorrhea. These side effects seem to be due to hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels) induced by these drugs  an effect that appears to be caused by serotonin-mediated inhibition of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons that inhibit prolactin secretion. It is noteworthy that the mammoplasia these drugs can cause has been found to be highly correlated with concomitant weight gain (in the 1997 study  83% of those who experienced weight gain also experienced mammoplasia  while only 30% of those who did not experience weight gain experienced mammoplasia). The mammoplasia associated with SSRIs is reported to be reversible with drug discontinuation. SSRIs have notably been associated with a modestly increased risk of breast cancer. This is in accordance with the fact that higher prolactin levels have been associated with increased breast cancer risk.In puberty induction with hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  in HRT for trans women  and in hormonal breast enhancement  mammoplasia may be a desired effect.
Pancreatic_cyst ,An pancreatic cyst is a fluid filled sac within the pancreas.Causes range from benign to malignant. Pancreatic pseudocysts can occur in the setting of pancreatitis  though they are only reliable diagnosed 6 weeks after the episode of acute pancreatitis. Benign tumors such as serous cystadenomas can occur. Main branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMNs) are associated with dilatation of the main pancreatic duct  while side branch IPMNs are typically benign  and not associated with dilatation. MRCP can help distinguish the position of the cysts relative to the pancreatic duct  and direct appropriate treatment and follow-up. The most common malignancy that can present as a pancreatic cyst is a mucinous cystic neoplasm.
Thermal_trauma ,Thermal trauma is any burn-related injury that can potentially lead to serious outcomes. There are various causes of thermal trauma  including fire  radiant heat  radiation  chemical  or electrical contact  that can affect a person in many ways based on factors from anatomical and physiological factors. Depending on the severity of the burns  quick management and transport to an appropriate burn facility may be necessary to prevent loss of life. Various classification scales exist for use with thermal trauma to determine the severity of the burns  which is used to determine the resources used and for statistical collection. The initial assessment is critical in determining the extent of injuries and what will be needed to manage an injury  and treating immediate life threats.
Zygomaticomaxillary_complex_fracture ,The zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture  also known as a quadripod fracture  quadramalar fracture  and formerly referred to as a tripod fracture or trimalar fracture  has four components: the lateral orbital wall (at either the zygomaticofrontal suture or zygomaticosphenoid suture)  separation of the maxilla and zygoma along the anterior maxilla (near the zygomaticomaxillary suture)  the zygomatic arch  and the orbital floor near the infraorbital canal. The zygomatic arch usually fractures at its weakest point  1.5 cm behind the zygomaticotemporal suture.
Ackerman_syndrome ,Ackerman syndrome is a familial syndrome of fused molar roots with a single canal (taurodontism)  hypotrichosis  full upper lip without a cupid’s bow  thickened and wide philtrum  and occasional juvenile glaucoma.It was described by James L. Ackerman  A. Leon Ackerman  and A. Bernard Ackerman It can also refer to interstitial granulomatous dermatitis.
Acrania ,Acrania is a rare congenital disorder that occurs in the human fetus in which the flat bones in the cranial vault are either completely or partially absent. The cerebral hemispheres develop completely but abnormally. The condition is frequently  though not always  associated with anencephaly. The fetus is said to suffer from acrania if it meets the following criteria: the fetus should have a perfectly normal facial bone  a normal cervical column but without the fetal skull and a volume of brain tissue equivalent to at least one third of the normal brain size.
Acute_kidney_injury ,Acute kidney injury (AKI)  previously called acute renal failure (ARF)  is an abrupt loss of kidney function that develops within 7 days.Its causes are numerous. Generally it occurs because of damage to the kidney tissue caused by decreased renal blood flow (renal ischemia) from any cause (e.g. low blood pressure)  exposure to substances harmful to the kidney  an inflammatory process in the kidney  or an obstruction of the urinary tract which impedes the flow of urine. AKI is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic laboratory findings  such as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine  or inability of the kidneys to produce sufficient amounts of urine.AKI may lead to a number of complications  including metabolic acidosis  high potassium levels  uremia  changes in body fluid balance  and effects on other organ systems  including death. People who have experienced AKI may have an increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the future. Management includes treatment of the underlying cause and supportive care  such as renal replacement therapy.
Acute_myeloid_leukemia ,Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL)  is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells  characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults  and its incidence increases with age. Although AML is a relatively rare disease  accounting for approximately 1.2% of cancer deaths in the United States  its incidence is expected to increase as the population ages.The symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells  which causes a drop in red blood cells  platelets  and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue  shortness of breath  easy bruising and bleeding  and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified  but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia  AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.AML has several subtypes; treatment and prognosis varies among subtypes. AML is cured in 35-40% of patients ≤60 years old and 5-15% >60 years old. Older patients who are not able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have a median survival of 5-10 months.AML is treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at inducing a remission; patients may go on to receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML has resulted in the availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular patient  as well as how long that patient is likely to survive.
Aerosol_burn ,  in pediatric and teenage patients.Adiabatic expansion causes the gas (with a low boiling temperature) to rapidly cool on exit from the aerosol applier. According to controlled laboratory experiments  the gas from a typical deodorant spray can drop up to sixty degrees Celsius.The form of injury is freezing of the skin  a type of frostbite. It is highly advised for those who suffer from frostbite to seek medical attention.In rare cases aerosol-induced burns can be severe enough to necessitate skin grafting.
Angiomyolipoma ,Angiomyolipomas are the most common benign tumour of the kidney and are composed of blood vessels  smooth muscle cells and fat cells. Angiomyolipomas are strongly associated with the genetic disease tuberous sclerosis  in which most individuals will have several angiomyolipomas affecting both kidneys. They are also commonly found in women with the rare lung disease lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Angiomyolipomas are less commonly found in the liver and rarely in other organs. Whether associated with these diseases or sporadic  angiomyolipomas are caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes  which govern cell growth and proliferation.Although regarded as benign  angiomyolipomas may grow such that kidney function is impaired or the blood vessels may dilate and burst leading to haemorrhage. Large angiomyolipoma can be treated with embolisation. Drug therapy for angiomyolipoma is at the research stage.
Antisocial_personality_disorder ,Antisocial (or dissocial) personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for  or violation of  the rights of others. There may be an impoverished moral sense or conscience and a history of crime  legal problems  and impulsive and aggressive behavior.Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is the name of the disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Dissocial personality disorder is the name of a similar or equivalent concept defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)  where it states that the diagnosis includes antisocial personality disorder. Both manuals have similar but not identical criteria. Both have also stated that their diagnoses have been referred to  or include what is referred to  as psychopathy or sociopathy  though distinctions are sometimes made.
Apparent_mineralocorticoid_excess_syndrome ,Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing hypertension (high blood pressure) and hypokalemia (abnormally low levels of potassium). The condition responds to glucocorticoid treatment. It results from mutations in the HSD11B2 gene  which encodes the kidney isozyme of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. In an unaffected individual  this isozyme inactivates circulating cortisol to the less-active metabolite cortisone. The inactivating mutation leads to elevated local concentrations of cortisol in the kidney. Cortisol at high concentrations can cross-react and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor  leading to aldosterone-like effects in the kidney. This is what causes the hypokalemia  hypertension  and hypernatremia associated with the syndrome.Other conditions such as Liddle's Syndrome can mimic the clinical features of AME  so diagnosis can be made by calculating the ratio of free urinary cortisol to free urinary cortisone. Since AME patients create less cortisone  the ratio will much be higher than non-affected patients. Alternatively  one could differentiate between the two syndromes by administering a potassium-sparing diuretic. Patients with Liddle's syndrome will only respond to a diuretic that binds the ENaC channel  whereas those with AME will respond to a diuretic that binds to ENaC or the mineralcorticoid receptor.AME is exceedingly rare  with less than 100 cases recorded worldwide.Liquorice consumption may also cause a temporary form of AME due to its ability to block 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2  in turn causing increased levels of cortisol. Cessation of licorice consumption will reverse this form of AME.
Arakawa's_syndrome_II ,Arakawa's syndrome II is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder that causes a deficiency of the enzyme tetrahydrofolate-methyltransferase; affected individuals cannot properly metabolize methylcobalamin  a type of Vitamin B12. It is also called Methionine synthase deficiency  Tetrahydrofolate-methyltransferase deficiency syndrome  and N5-methylhomocysteine transferase deficiency.
Atypical_ductal_hyperplasia ,Atypical ductal hyperplasia  abbreviated ADH  is the term used for a benign lesion of the breast that indicates an increased risk of breast cancer.The name of the entity is descriptive of the lesion; ADH is characterized by cellular proliferation (hyperplasia) within one or two breast ducts and (histomorphologic) architectural abnormalities  i.e. the cells are arranged in an abnormal or atypical way.In the context of a core (needle) biopsy  ADH is considered an indication for a breast lumpectomy  also known as a surgical (excisional) biopsy  to exclude the presence of breast cancer.
Auditory_processing_disorder ,Auditory processing disorder (APD)  also known as central auditory processing disorder (CAPD)  is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes auditory information. Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer  middle and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However  they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do  which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds  especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the central nervous system.APD does not feature in mainstream diagnostic classifications such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  4th Edition (DSM-IV). The American Academy of Audiology notes that APD is diagnosed by difficulties in one or more auditory processes known to reflect the function of the central auditory nervous system.APD can affect both children and adults  although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It has been suggested that males are twice as likely to be affected by the disorder as females  but there are no good epidemiological studies.
Avoidant_personality_disorder ,Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD)  also known as anxious personality disorder  is a Cluster C personality disorder recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders handbook as afflicting persons when they display a pervasive pattern of social inhibition  feelings of inadequacy and inferiority  extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation  and avoidance of social interaction despite a strong desire to be close to others. Individuals afflicted with the disorder tend to describe themselves as uneasy  anxious  lonely  unwanted and isolated from others.People with avoidant personality disorder often consider themselves to be socially inept or personally unappealing and avoid social interaction for fear of being ridiculed  humiliated  rejected  or disliked. As the name suggests  the main coping mechanism of those with avoidant personality disorder is avoidance of feared stimuli. Avoidant personality disorder is usually first noticed in early adulthood  with both childhood emotional neglect and peer group rejection being associated with an increased risk for its development.
Basilar_skull_fracture ,A basilar skull fracture (or basal skull fracture) is a fracture of the base of the skull  typically involving the temporal bone  occipital bone  sphenoid bone  and/or ethmoid bone.This type of fracture is rare  occurring as the only fracture in just 4% of severe head injury patients.Such fractures can cause tears in the membranes surrounding the brain  or meninges  with resultant leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The leaking fluid may accumulate in the middle ear space  and dribble out through a perforated eardrum (CSF otorrhea) or into the nasopharynx via the eustachian tube  causing a salty taste. CSF may also drip from the nose (CSF rhinorrhea) in fractures of the anterior skull base  yielding a halo sign. These signs are characteristic for basilar skull fractures.
Birth_trauma_(physical) , focuses largely on mechanical damage. Caput succedaneum  subcutaneous hemorrhages  small subperiostal hemorrhages  hemorrhages along the displacements of cranial bones  intradural bleedings  subcapsular haematomas of liver  are among the more commonly reported birth injuries. Birth trauma  on the other hand  encompasses the enduring side effects of physical birth injuries  including the ensuing compensatory and adaptive mechanisms and the development of pathological processes (pathogenesis) after the damage.
Blackwater_fever , and was the first to successfully treat such cases following the publication of his pamphlet.
Bladder_sphincter_dyssynergia ,Bladder sphincter dyssynergia (also known as detrusor sphincter dysynergia (DSD) (the ICS standard terminology agreed 1998) and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO)) is a consequence of a neurological pathology such as spinal injury or multiple sclerosis that disrupts central nervous system regulation of the micturition (urination) reflex resulting in dyscoordination of the detrusor muscles of the bladder and the male or female external urethral sphincter muscles. In normal lower urinary tract function  these two separate muscle structures act in synergistic coordination. But in this neurogenic disorder  the urethral sphincter muscle  instead of relaxing completely during voiding  dyssynergically contracts causing the flow to be interrupted and the bladder pressure to rise.On cystography there is an irregular appearance of the bladder outline due to muscular contraction against the unrelaxed bladder sphincter.
Blue_balls ,. The condition is not experienced by all males.
Body_dysmorphic_disorder ,Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)  also termed body dysmorphia or dysmorphic syndrome  but originally termed dysmorphophobia  is a mental disorder via obsessive preoccupation with a perceived defect in one's own appearance  viewed as so severe as to warrant exceptional measures to hide or fix it. In BDD's delusional variant  the flaw is imagined. If the flaw is actual  its importance is severely exaggerated. Distinguished from anorexia nervosa  BDD is categorized in the obsessive–compulsive spectrum.A fairly common mental disorder  affecting some 1% to 2% of the population  BDD usually starts during adolescence  and affects men and women roughly equally. (The BDD subtype muscle dysmorphia  whereby one obsesses that one's body or some part of it is too small.) In fear of being thought vain  persons experiencing BDD tend to keep the preoccupation secret  and BDD is severely underdiagnosed. Severely impairing quality of life  BDD can lead to social isolation and involves especially high rates of suicidal ideation.
Brain_death , (death of the cerebrum)  the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the brainstem. The distinctions can be important because  for example  in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem  the heartbeat and ventilation can continue unaided  whereas in whole-brain death (which includes brain stem death)  only life support equipment would keep those functions going. Patients classified as brain-dead can have their organs surgically removed for organ donation; though not everyone agrees with this practice  preferring to limit organ donation to those individuals who have suffered the death of all of their brain and the death of their cardiac and respiratory systems (biological  or full  death). However  if one limits the criteria to those individuals  procuring viable organs can become much more difficult.
Brenner_tumour ,Brenner tumors are an uncommon subtype of the surface epithelial-stromal tumor group of ovarian neoplasms. The majority are benign  but some can be malignant.They are most frequently found incidentally on pelvic examination or at laparotomy. Brenner tumours very rarely can occur in other locations  including the testes.
Brill–Zinsser_disease ,Brill–Zinser disease is a delayed relapse of epidemic typhus  caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. After a patient contracts epidemic typhus from the fecal matter of an infected louse (Pediculus humanus)  the rickettsia can remain latent and reactivate months or years later  with symptoms similar to or even identical to the original attack of typhus  including a maculopapular rash. This reactivation event can then be transmitted to other individuals through fecal matter of the louse vector  and form the focus for a new epidemic of typhus.
Cancer_of_unknown_primary_origin ,Cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) is a term used to describe a cancer that is determined to be at the metastatic stage at the time of diagnosis  but a primary tumor cannot be identified. A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture consistent with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a primary tumor.CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer  and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances. The other 15 to 20% of patients  however  have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment.
Cardiac_arrhythmia ,Cardiac arrhythmia  also known as cardiac dysrhythmia or irregular heartbeat  is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is irregular  too fast  or too slow. A heartbeat that is too fast - above 100 beats per minute in adults - is called tachycardia and a heartbeat that is too slow - below 60 beats per minute - is called bradycardia. Many arrhythmias have no symptoms. When symptoms are present these may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats. More seriously there may be lightheadedness  passing out  shortness of breath  or chest pain. While most arrhythmias are not serious some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Others may result in cardiac arrest.There are four main types of arrhythmias: extra beats  supraventricular tachycardias  ventricular arrhythmias  and bradyarrhythmias. Extra beats include premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions. Supraventricular tachycardias include atrial fibrillation  atrial flutter  and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Ventricular arrhymias include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. Arrhythmias are due to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart. Arrhythmias may occur in children; however  the normal range for the heart rate is different and depends on age. A number of tests can help with diagnosis including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and holter monitor.Most arrhythmias can be effectively treated. Treatments may include medications  medical procedures such as a pacemaker  and surgery. Medications for a fast heart rate may include beta blockers or agents that attempt to restore a normal heart rhythm such as procainamide. This later group may have more significant side effects especially if taken for a long period of time. Pacemakers are often used for slow heart rates. Those with an irregular heartbeat are often treated with blood thinners to reduce the risk of complications. Those who have severe symptoms from an arrhythmia may be treated emergently with a jolt of electricity in the form of cardioversion or defibrillation.Arrhythmias affect millions of people. In Europe and North America  as of 2014  atrial fibrillation affects about 2% to 3% of the population. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter resulted in 112 000 deaths in 2013  up from 29 000 in 1990. Sudden cardiac death is the cause of about half of deaths due to cardiovascular disease or about 15% of all deaths globally. About 80% of sudden cardiac death is the result of ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may occur at any age but are more common among older people.
Cat-scratch_disease ,Cat-scratch disease (CSD)  also known as cat-scratch fever  Teeny's disease  inoculation lymphoreticulosis  and subacute regional lymphadenitis  is a common and usually benign infectious disease caused by a bacterium  either Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. It is most commonly found in children following a scratch or bite from a cat within about one to two weeks.
Cavernous_sinus_thrombosis ,Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is the formation of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus  a cavity at the base of the brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose  sinuses  ears  or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria. Cavernous sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or loss of vision  chemosis  exophthalmos (bulging eyes)  headaches  and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the cavernous sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment  which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage.
Central_serous_retinopathy ,Central serous retinopathy (CSR)  also known as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC)  is an eye disease which causes visual impairment  often temporary  usually in one eye. When the disorder is active it is characterized by leakage of fluid under the retina that has a propensity to accumulate under the central macula. This results in blurred or distorted vision (metamorphopsia). A blurred or gray spot in the central visual field is common when the retina is detached. Reduced visual acuity may persist after the fluid has disappeared.The disease is considered idiopathic but mostly affects white males in the age group 20 to 50 and occasionally other groups. The condition is believed to be exacerbated by stress or corticosteroid use.
Childhood_disintegrative_disorder ,  being that this term can now refer to any type of autism spectrum disorder that involves regression  including CDD.CDD was originally described by Austrian educator Theodor Heller (1869 – 1938) in 1908  35 years before Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger described autism. Heller had previously used the name dementia infantilis for the syndrome.An apparent period of fairly normal development is often noted before a regression in skills or a series of regressions in skills. The age at which this regression can occur varies  but typically after 3 years of normal development. The regression can be so dramatic that the child may be aware of it  and may in its beginning even ask  vocally  what is happening to her/him. Some children describe or appear to be reacting to hallucinations  but the most obvious symptom is that skills apparently attained are lost.Many children are already somewhat delayed when the disorder becomes apparent  but these delays are not always obvious in young children. This has been described by many writers as a devastating condition  affecting both the family and the individual's future. As is the case with all pervasive developmental disorder categories  there is considerable controversy about the right treatment for CDD.
Cholangiocarcinoma ,Cholangiocarcinoma is a form of cancer that is composed of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include pancreatic cancer  gallbladder cancer  and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.Cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively rare neoplasm that is classified as an adenocarcinoma (a cancer that forms glands or secretes significant amounts of mucins). It has an annual incidence rate of 1–2 cases per 100 000 in the Western world  but rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide over the past several decades.Prominent signs and symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests  abdominal pain  jaundice  and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching  fever  and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests  imaging  endoscopy  and sometimes surgical exploration  with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts)  congenital liver malformations  infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis  and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide)  a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However  most patients with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable specific risk factors.Cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and rapidly lethal malignancy unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully resected (removed surgically). No potentially curative treatment yet exists except surgery  but most patients have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though never cured - with chemotherapy  radiation therapy  and other palliative care measures. These are also used as adjuvant therapies (i.e. post-surgically) in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).
Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia ,Chronic myelogenous (or myeloid or myelocytic) leukemia (CML)  also known as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL)  is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of predominantly myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils  eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. It is a type of myeloproliferative disease associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome. CML is now largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since the introduction of the first such agent in 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries it accounts for 15-20% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population).
Combat_stress_reaction , depended on the circumstances. The large proportion of World War I veterans in the European population meant that the symptoms were common to the culture.
Conductive_hearing_loss ,Conductive hearing loss occurs when there is a problem conducting sound waves anywhere along the route through the outer ear  tympanic membrane (eardrum)  or middle ear (ossicles).This type of hearing loss may occur in conjunction with sensorineural hearing loss or alone.If the hearing loss is unilateral  the Weber test  in which a tuning fork is touched to the midline of the forehead  can determine which ear is affected; the person will hear the loudest sound in the affected ear. The Rinne test  which tests air conduction versus bone conduction is negative (abnormal result).
Congenital_diaphragmatic_hernia ,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital malformation (birth defect) of the diaphragm. The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia; other types include Morgagni hernia  diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity  hindering proper lung formation.CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants  and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions  with some focusing on hypoplasia  others on hypertension. Newborns with CDH often have severe respiratory distress which can be life-threatening unless treated appropriately.
Congenital_disorder , and involve defects in a developing fetus. Birth defects vary widely in cause and symptoms. Any substance that causes birth defects is known as a teratogen. Some disorders can be detected before birth through prenatal diagnosis (screening).Birth defects may be the result of genetic or environmental factors. This includes errors of morphogenesis  infection  epigenetic modifications on a parental germline  or a chromosomal abnormality. The outcome of the disorder will depend on complex interactions between the pre-natal deficit and the post-natal environment. Animal studies indicate that the mother's (and likely the father's) diet  vitamin intake  and glucose levels prior to ovulation and conception have long-term effects on fetal growth and adolescent and adult disease. Animal studies have shown that paternal exposures prior to conception and during pregnancy result in increased risk of certain birth defects and cancers. This research suggests that paternal food deprivation  germ line mutations  alcohol use  chemical mutagens  age  smoking habits and epigenetic alterations can affect birth outcomes. However  the relationship between offspring health and paternal exposures  age  and lifestyle are still relatively weak. This is likely because paternal exposures and their effects on the fetus are studied far less extensively than maternal exposures.Birth defects are present in about 3% of newborns. Congenital anomalies resulted in about 632 000 deaths per year in 2013 down from 751 000 in 1990. The type with the greatest death are congenital heart disease (323 000)  followed by neural tube defects (69 000).
Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain ,Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)  also known as congenital analgesia  is one or more rare conditions in which a person cannot feel (and has never felt) physical pain. The conditions described here are separate from the HSAN group of disorders  which have more specific signs and etiology. Despite sounding beneficial  it is actually an extremely dangerous condition.
Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain_with_anhidrosis , indicates that the condition is present from birth.
Critical_illness_polyneuropathy ,Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness myopathy (CIM) are overlapping syndromes of diffuse  symmetric  flaccid muscle weakness occurring in critically ill patients and involving all extremities and the diaphragm with relative sparing of the cranial nerves. CIP and CIM have similar symptoms and presentations and are often distinguished largely on the basis of specialized electrophysiologic testing or muscle and nerve biopsy. The causes of CIP and CIM are unknown  though they are thought to be a possible neurological manifestation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents  which are widely used in intensive care  may contribute to the development of CIP and CIM  as may elevations in blood sugar  which frequently occur in critically ill patients.CIP was first described by Charles F. Bolton in a series of five patients.Combined CIP and CIM was first described by Nicola Latronico in a series of 24 patients.
Cryopyrin-associated_periodic_syndrome ,Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is a spectrum of autoinflammatory syndromes including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS  formerly termed familial cold-induced urticaria)  the Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS)  and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID  also called chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome or CINCA). They share many clinical features.These syndromes are associated with mutations in NLRP3  the gene encoding cryopyrin. This is a component of the interleukin 1 inflammasome  and mutations lead to unregulated production of interleukin 1β. Monoclonal antibodies against interleukin 1β (such as canakinumab)  other interleukin 1 binding proteins (such as rilonacept)  or interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (for example anakinra) can be used to treat these disorders.
Cushing's_disease ,Cushing's disease (also known as Cushing disease  tertiary or secondary hypercortisolism  tertiary or secondary hypercorticism  Itsenko-Cushing disease) is a cause of Cushing's syndrome characterised by increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary (secondary hypercortisolism). This is most often as a result of a pituitary adenoma (specifically pituitary basophilism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (Corticotropin releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) that stimulates the synthesis of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Pituitary adenomas are responsible for 80% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome  when excluding Cushing's syndrome from exogenously administered corticosteroids.This should not be confused with ectopic Cushing syndrome or exogenous steroid use.
Cushing_ulcer ,A Cushing ulcer is a gastric ulcer produced by elevated intracranial pressure. It is also called von Rokitansky-Cushing syndrome. Apart from in the stomach  it may also develop in the proximal part of the duodenum and the distal esophagus.It is named for Harvey Cushing.
Cutaneous_leishmaniasis ,Cutaneous leishmaniasis (also known as oriental sore  tropical sore  chiclero ulcer  or chiclero's ulcer) is the most common form of leishmaniasis affecting humans. It is a skin infection caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted by the bite of a phlebotomine sandfly. There are about twenty species of Leishmania that may cause cutaneous leishmaniasis.This disease is considered to be a zoonosis (an infectious disease that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans)  with the exception of Leishmania tropica — which is often an anthroponotic disease (an infectious disease that is naturally transmissible from humans to vertebrate animals).
Dental_caries ,)  also known as tooth decay  cavities  or caries  is a breakdown of teeth due to activities of bacteria. The cavities may be a number of different colors from yellow to black. Symptoms may include pain and difficulty with eating. Complications may include inflammation of the tissue around the tooth  tooth loss  and infection or abscess formation.The cause of caries is bacterial break down of the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel  dentin and cementum). This occurs due to acid made from food debris or sugar on the tooth surface. Simple sugars in food are these bacteria's primary energy source and thus a diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than build up from sources such as saliva  caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva such as: diabetes mellitus  Sjogren's syndrome and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include antihistamines and antidepressants among others. Caries are also associated with poverty  poor cleaning of the mouth  and receding gums resulting in exposure of the roots of the teeth.Prevention includes: regular cleaning of the teeth  a diet low in sugar  and small amounts of fluoride. Brushing the teeth two times per day and flossing between the teeth once a day is recommended by many. Fluoride may be from water  salt or toothpaste among other sources. Treating a mother's dental caries may decrease the risk in her children by decreasing the numbers of certain bacteria. Screening can result in earlier detection. Depending on the extent of destruction  various treatments can be used to restore the tooth to proper function or the tooth may be removed. There is no known method to grow back large amounts of tooth. The availability of treatment is often poor in the developing world. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be taken for pain.Worldwide  approximately 2.43 billion people (36% of the population) have dental caries in their permanent teeth. The World Health Organizations estimates that nearly all adults have dental caries at some point in time. In baby teeth it affects about 620 million people or 9% of the population. They have become more common in both children and adults in recent years. The disease is most common in the developed world and less common in the developing world due to greater simple sugar consumption.
Dermatitis_herpetiformis ,Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)  or Duhring's disease  is a chronic blistering skin condition  characterised by blisters filled with a watery fluid. Despite its name  DH is neither related to nor caused by herpes virus: the name means that it is a skin inflammation having an appearance similar to herpes.DH was first described by Louis Adolphus Duhring in 1884. A connection between DH and celiac disease was recognised in 1967  although the exact causal mechanism is not known. DH is a specific manifestation of celiac disease.The age of onset is usually about 15-40  but DH can also affect children and the elderly. Men and women are equally affected. Estimates of DH prevalence vary from 1 in 400 to 1 in 10000. It is most common in patients of northern European/northern Indian ancestry  and is associated with the HLA-DQ2 haplotype along with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.
Developmental_coordination_disorder ,Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) also known as developmental dyspraxia is a chronic neurological disorder beginning in childhood that can affect planning of movements and co-ordination as a result of brain messages not being accurately transmitted to the body. Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed in the absence of other neurological impairments like cerebral palsy  muscular dystrophy  multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease.
Diffuse_idiopathic_skeletal_hyperostosis , appearance along the spine on radiographic studies.The calcification and ossification is most common on the right side of the spine. In people with dextrocardia and situs inversus this calcification occurs on the left side  which confirms the role of the descending thoracic aorta in preventing the physical manifestations of DISH on one side of the spine.
Diphallia ,Diphallia  penile duplication (PD)  diphallic terata  or diphallasparatus  is a rare developmental abnormality in which a male infant is born with two penises. The first reported case was by Johannes Jacob Wecker in 1609. Its occurrence is 1 in 5.5 million men in the United States.When diphallia is present  it is usually accompanied by renal  vertebral  hindgut  anorectal or other congenital anomalies. There is also a higher risk of spina bifida. Infants born with PD and its related conditions have a higher death rate from various infections associated with their more complex renal or colorectal systems.It is thought diphallia occurs in the fetus between the 23rd and 25th days of gestation when an injury  chemical stress  or malfunctioning homeobox genes hamper proper function of the caudal cell mass of the fetal mesoderm as the urogenital sinus separates from the genital tubercle and rectum to form the penis.
Disorders_of_sex_development , The term has been controversial; the World Health Organization and many medical journals still reference DSDs as intersex traits or conditions.
Drug-induced_lupus_erythematosus ,Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DIL or DILE) is an autoimmune disorder (similar to systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) caused by chronic use of certain drugs. These drugs cause an autoimmune response (the body attacks its own cells) producing symptoms similar to those of SLE. There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases: hydralazine  procainamide  and isoniazid. While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established  symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain. Generally  the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs.
Ebstein's_anomaly ,Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital heart defect in which the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve are displaced towards the apex of the right ventricle of the heart.
Ejaculatory_duct_obstruction ,Ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO) is a congenital or acquired pathological condition which is characterized by the obstruction of one or both ejaculatory ducts. Thus  the efflux of (most constituents of) semen is not possible.It is a cause of male infertility and / or pelvic pain. Ejaculatory duct obstruction must not be confused with an obstruction of the vas deferens.
Erythema_annulare_centrifugum ,) is a descriptive term for a skin lesion. The lesions form consists of redness (erythema) in a ring form (anulare) that spreads from the center (centrifugum). EAC was first described by Darier in 1916. Many different terms have been used to classify these types of lesions and it is still controversial on what exactly defines EAC. Some of the types include (deep and superficial) annular erythema  erythema perstans  erythema gyratum perstans  erythema gyratum repens  darier erythema (Deep gyrate erythema & Deep gyrate erythema) and erythema figuratum perstans.
Erythema_multiforme ,Erythema multiforme is a skin condition of unknown cause  possibly mediated by deposition of immune complex (mostly IgM) in the superficial microvasculature of the skin and oral mucous membrane that usually follows an infection or drug exposure. It is an uncommon disorder  with peak incidence in the second and third decades of life.
Erythema_nodosum ,Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory condition characterised by inflammation of the fat cells under the skin  resulting in tender red nodules or lumps that are usually seen on both shins. It can be caused by a variety of conditions  and typically resolves spontaneously within 3–6 weeks. It is common in young people between 12–20 years of age.
Extramammary_Paget's_disease ,Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD)  also extramammary Paget disease  is a rare  slow-growing  usually noninvasive intraepithelial (in the skin) adenocarcinoma outside of the mammary gland and includes Paget's disease of the vulva and the extremely rare Paget's disease of the penis.
Familial_dysautonomia ,Familial dysautonomia (FD)  sometimes called Riley–Day syndrome and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III (HSAN-III) — is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system which affects the development and survival of sensory  sympathetic and some parasympathetic neurons in the autonomic and sensory nervous system resulting in variable symptoms including: insensitivity to pain  inability to produce tears  poor growth  and labile blood pressure (episodic hypertension and postural hypotension). People with FD have frequent vomiting crises  pneumonia  problems with speech and movement  difficulty swallowing  inappropriate perception of heat  pain  and taste  as well as unstable blood pressure and gastrointestinal dysmotility. FD does not affect intelligence. Originally reported by Conrad Milton Riley and Richard Lawrence Day in 1949  FD is one example of a group of disorders known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN). All HSAN are characterized by widespread sensory dysfunction and variable autonomic dysfunction caused by incomplete development of sensory and autonomic neurons. The disorders are believed to be genetically distinct from each other.
Familial_hypercholesterolemia ,)  in the blood and early cardiovascular disease. Since individuals with FH underlying body biochemistry is slightly different  their high cholesterol levels are less responsive to the kinds of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH (such as dietary modification and statin tablets). Nevertheless  treatment (including higher statin doses) is usually effective. Many people have mutations in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein  which normally removes LDL from the circulation  or apolipoprotein B (ApoB)  which is the part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may have premature cardiovascular disease at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder  inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern  occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer  occurring in 1 in a million births.Heterozygous FH is normally treated with statins  bile acid sequestrants  or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often does not respond to medical therapy and may require other treatments  including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.
Fecal_occult_blood ,Fecal occult blood (FOB) refers to blood in the feces that is not visibly apparent (unlike other types of blood in stool such as melena or hematochezia). A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) checks for hidden (occult) blood in the stool (feces). Newer tests look for globin  DNA  or other blood factors including transferrin  while conventional stool guaiac tests look for heme.
Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder ,Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Problems may include an abnormal appearance  short height  low body weight  small head  poor coordination  low intelligence  behavior problems  and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected more commonly have trouble in school  have trouble with law enforcement  are frequently jailed  are involved in high risk sexual activity  and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Other types including partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS)  alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Surveys from the United States  have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk in the last month and 20% to 30% drank at some point during the pregnancy. About 4% of women who are pregnant have alcohol use disorder. The risk of problems depends on the amount  frequency  and when during pregnancy alcohol is consumed. Other risk factors include an older mother  smoking  and a mother who has poor nutrition. There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy. While small amounts of alcohol do not cause an abnormal appearance it may cause behavioral issues. Alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby. Diagnosis is based on a person's signs and symptoms.Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are preventable by avoiding alcohol. Medical organizations recommend no alcohol during pregnancy for this reason. While the condition is permanent  treatment can improve outcomes. This may include parent-child interaction therapy  efforts to modify behavior  and possibly medications.FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States. In South Africa  some populations have rates as high as 9%. The negative effects of alcohol have been described since ancient times. The lifetime cost of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002. The term fetal alcohol syndrome was first used in 1973.
Florid_cutaneous_papillomatosis ,Florid cutaneous papillomatosis (also known as the Schwartz-Burgess syndrome) is an obligate paraneoplastic syndrome.FCP begins as the sudden onset of numerous cutaneous papillomas that are clinically indistinguishable from viral warts. The papillomas range from 1 to 3 mm in diameter may spread to involve the entire body  including the face. Pruritus  which may sometimes precede the onset of FCP  is evident in the affected regions in about half of patients. Evaluation of a skin biopsy clearly distinguishes FCP from viral warts.FCP is associated with underlying cancer of the breast  bladder  ovary  uterus  prostate  and lung. Other associated underlying malignancies include squamous cell carcinomas and lymphomas such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.FCP is sometimes seen together with other signs of internal cancer  especially malignant acanthosis nigricans  tripe palms  Leser–Trélat sign  and hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita. FCP tends to improve in association with surgical or chemotherapeutic therapy of the underlying internal cancer. A recurrence or exacerbation of FCP may be linked with tumor regrowth or metastatic spread.
Foreign_body ,A foreign body or sometimes known as FB (Latin: corpus alienum) is any object originating outside the body. In machinery  it can mean any unwanted intruding object.Most references to foreign bodies involve propulsion through natural orifices into hollow organs.Foreign bodies can be inert or irritating. If they irritate they will cause inflammation and scarring. They can bring infection into the body or acquire infectious agents and protect them from the body's immune defenses. They can obstruct passageways either by their size or by the scarring they cause. Some can be toxic.With sufficient force (as in firing of bullets)  a foreign body can become lodged into nearly any tissue.
Foreign_body_granuloma ,The foreign body granuloma is a response of biological tissue to any foreign material in the tissue. Tissue-encapsulation of an implant is part of this. An infection around a splinter is part of this  too.The presence of the implant changes the healing response  and this is called the foreign-body reaction (FBR). FBR consists of: protein adsorption  macrophages  multinucleated foreign body giant cells (macrophage fusion)  fibroblasts  and angiogenesis.It can be caused by beryllium.
Generalized_anxiety_disorder ,Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive  uncontrollable and often irrational worry  that is  apprehensive expectation about events or activities. This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning  as individuals with GAD typically anticipate disaster  and are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues  money  death  family problems  friendship problems  interpersonal relationship problems  or work difficulties. Individuals often exhibit a variety of physical symptoms  including fatigue  fidgeting  headaches  nausea  numbness in hands and feet  muscle tension  muscle aches  difficulty swallowing  bouts of breathing difficulty  difficulty concentrating  trembling  twitching  irritability  agitation  sweating  restlessness  insomnia  hot flashes  rashes  and inability to fully control the anxiety (ICD-10). These symptoms must be consistent and ongoing  persisting at least six months  for a formal diagnosis of GAD.In a given year  approximately 6.8 million American adults and two percent of European adults experience GAD. GAD is seen in women twice as much as men. GAD is also common in individuals with a history of substance abuse and a family history of the disorder. Once GAD develops  it may become chronic  but can be managed or eliminated with proper treatment.Standardized rating scales such as GAD-7 can be used to assess severity of GAD symptoms. GAD is the most common cause of disability in the workplace in the United States.
Gorham's_disease ,Gorham's disease (pronounced GOR-amz)  also known as Gorham vanishing bone disease and phantom bone disease  is a very rare skeletal condition of unknown cause  characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of distended  thin-walled vascular or lymphatic channels within bone  which leads to resorption and replacement of bone with angiomas and/or fibrosis. Current treatments are experimental only.
Group_B_streptococcal_infection ,  alludes to this.
HEC_syndrome ,HEC syndrome is a syndrome characterized by hydrocephalus  endocardial fibroelastosis and cataracts.
Hashimoto's_thyroiditis ,Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is attacked by a variety of cell- and antibody-mediated immune processes  causing primary hypothyroidism. It was the first disease to be recognized as an autoimmune disease. It was first described by the Japanese specialist Hakaru Hashimoto in a paper published in Germany in 1912.
Hereditary_neuralgic_amyotrophy ,Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA) is a neuralgic disorder that is characterized by nerve damage and muscle atrophy  preceded by severe pain. It is caused by a mutation in the SEPT9 gene (17q25). While not much is known about this disorder  it has been characterized to be similar to Parsonage-Turner syndrome in prognosis. For a comprehensive overview of hereditary and idiopathic neuralgic amyotrophy and its consequences for patients: please see the pdf file link at the bottom of this page.
Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colorectal_cancer ,Lynch syndrome (HNPCC or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that has a high risk of colon cancer as well as other cancers including endometrial cancer (second most common)  ovary  stomach  small intestine  hepatobiliary tract  upper urinary tract  brain  and skin. The increased risk for these cancers is due to inherited mutations that impair DNA mismatch repair. It is a type of cancer syndrome.
Hereditary_sensory_and_autonomic_neuropathy ,Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) or hereditary sensory neuropathy (HSN) is a condition used to describe any of the types of this disease which inhibit sensation. They are less common than Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
Herpesviral_encephalitis ,Herpesviral encephalitis is encephalitis due to herpes simplex virus.Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a viral infection of the human central nervous system. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 500 000 individuals per year and some studies suggest an incidence rate of 5.9 cases per 100 000 live births. The majority of cases of herpes encephalitis are caused by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)  the same virus that causes cold sores. 57% of American adults are infected with HSV-1  which is spread through droplets  casual contact  and sometimes sexual contact  though most infected people never have cold sores. About 10% of cases of herpes encephalitis are due to HSV-2  which is typically spread through sexual contact. About 1 in 3 cases of HSE result from primary HSV-1 infection  predominantly occurring in individuals under the age of 18; 2 in 3 cases occur in seropositive persons  few of whom have history of recurrent orofacial herpes. Approximately 50% of individuals that develop HSE are over 50 years of age.
Hidradenitis_suppurativa , nature of it  it is frequently misdiagnosed. There is currently no known cure nor any consistently effective treatment. HS forums offer great insight.Carbon dioxide laser surgery has been shown as an effective treatment providing quality of life improvement  with peer reviewed articles showing an 80% chance of non recurrence in the surgically removed site.Lukewarm Sitz baths can provide great relief  gentle antiseptic skin cleansers and hydrogen peroxide assist in keeping affected areas free of bacteria.HS is an orphan disease due to lack of publicity and sparse research efforts. The incidence of HS is not well established  but has been estimated as being between 1:24 (4.1%) and 1:600 (0.2%).
Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause) ,Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in menopause is medical treatment in surgically menopausal  perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Its goal is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estrogen and progesterone hormones in menopause. Combination HRT is often recommended as it decreases the amount of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer associated with unopposed estrogen therapy. The main hormones involved are estrogen  progesterone and progestin. Some recent therapies include the use of androgens as well.The 2002 Women's Health Initiative of the National Institutes of Health found disparate results for all cause mortality with hormone replacement  finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier  between age 50-59  but higher when begun after age 60. In older patients  there was an increased incidence of breast cancer  heart attacks and stroke  although a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and bone fracture. Some of the WHI findings were again found in a larger national study done in the UK  known as The Million Women Study. As a result of these findings  the number of women taking hormone treatment dropped precipitously. The Women's Health Initiative recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time to minimize associated risks.The current indications for use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms  such as vasomotor hot flashes or urogenital atrophy  and prevention of osteoporosis. In 2012  the United States Preventive Task Force concluded that the harmful effects of combined estrogen and progestin are likely to exceed the chronic disease prevention benefits in most women. A consensus expert opinion published by the The Endocrine Society stated that when taken during perimenopause  or the initial years of menopause  hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published  and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology also released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in appropriate clinical scenarios.
Hypervitaminosis , for most vitamins.High dosage vitamin A; high dosage  slow release vitamin B3; and very high dosage vitamin B6 alone (i.e. without vitamin B complex) are sometimes associated with vitamin side effects that usually rapidly cease with supplement reduction or cessation.
Idiopathic_hypersomnia ,
Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura ,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)  also known as primary immune thrombocytopenia  primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura or autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura  is defined as isolated low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) with normal bone marrow and the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. It causes a characteristic purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and has a spontaneous resolution within 2 months. Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura persists longer than 6 months with a specific cause being unknown. ITP is an autoimmune disease with antibodies detectable against several platelet surface antigens.ITP is diagnosed by a low platelet count in a complete blood count (a common blood test). However  since the diagnosis depends on the exclusion of other causes of a low platelet count  additional investigations (such as a bone marrow biopsy) may be necessary in some cases.In mild cases  only careful observation may be required but very low counts or significant bleeding may prompt treatment with corticosteroids  intravenous immunoglobulin  anti-D immunoglobulin  or immunosuppressive drugs. Refractory ITP (not responsive to conventional treatment) may require splenectomy  the surgical removal of the spleen. Platelet transfusions may be used in severe bleeding together with a very low count. Sometimes the body may compensate by making abnormally large platelets.
Inflammatory_bowel_disease ,Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the principal types of inflammatory bowel disease. It is important to note that not only does Crohn's disease affect the small intestine and large intestine  it can also affect the mouth  esophagus  stomach and the anus whereas ulcerative colitis primarily affects the colon and the rectum.Inflammatory bowel diseases resulted in 51 000 deaths in 2013 and 55 000 deaths in 1990.
Inherited_disorders_of_trafficking ,Inherited disorders of trafficking (IDT) are a family of disorders that involve vesicular delivery of proteins.They were characterized in 1975.
Injection_site_reaction ,Injection site reactions are allergic reactions that result in cutaneous necrosis that may occur at sites of medication injection  typically presenting in one of two forms  (1) those associated with intravenous infusion or (2) those related to intramuscular injection. Intra muscular injections may produce a syndrome called livedo dermatitis.
Intermittent_explosive_disorder , category. The disorder itself is not easily characterized and often exhibits comorbidity with other mood disorders  particularly bipolar disorder. Individuals diagnosed with IED report their outbursts as being brief (lasting less than an hour)  with a variety of bodily symptoms (sweating  stuttering  chest tightness  twitching  palpitations) reported by a third of one sample. Aggressive acts are frequently reported accompanied by a sensation of relief and in some cases pleasure  but often followed by later remorse.
